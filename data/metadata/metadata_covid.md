Data on COVID-19 cases from the Johns Hopkins University dashboard have been provided directly with the research compendium because the data is no longer available online in the state in which it was downloaded on August 1, 2020.
The dashboard and cumulative counts of COVID-19 cases and deaths were continually updated, so an exact reproduction required communication with the original author, Jayajit Chakraborty, for assistance with provision of data from August 1, 2020.
The data includes an estimate of the total population (`POP_ESTIMA`) and confirmed COVID-19 cases (`Confirmed`).
The COVID-19 case data expresses cumulative count of reported COVID-19 from 1/22/2020 to 8/1/2020.
Although metadata for this particular resource is no longer available from the original source, one can reasonably assume that the total population estimate was based on the 2014-2018 5-year ACS estimate, as the 2019 estimates data had not been released yet.
